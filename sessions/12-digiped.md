- It can mean a lot of different things to different people
- Frameworks & definitions
  - Blended Learning @ BMC - technologies to facilitate classroom work (mostly pretty technical)
  - OpenSource/Open Access vs. using things that are proprietary/Freemium
- Backwards design: start with learning goals, then move to use technologies that facilitate that
  - Technology could be the goal in itself, but you shouldn't use technology for its own sake
- Scaffolding: the 'zone of proximal development'
  - Not too much time on background, but make sure it's coming up
  - IEP // specific differentiation
- SAMR: Reuben Puentedura - tech integration
  - Substitution - Zoom (substitue for physical classroom)
  - Augmentation - Moodle, PowerPoint (provides extra options compared to no-tech alternatives)
  - Modification - WordPress & Scalar (significant task redesign)
  - Redefinition - AR/VR - sandbox water flow simulation
- Simulation of Roman buildings
