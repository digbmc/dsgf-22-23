## Agenda
1. Announcements & Updates
2. Command line questions & review
3. Instruction topic
4. Other

## Meeting notes
Note-taker: Kari

### Review
- Check-in on how command line workshop went

### Project Updates

- Kari: redefining Python goals, looking into mapping for, e.g., distribution of find contexts – StoryMap? GIS? Python applications? Building a new prototype or    finding something preexisting?
- Mallory: StoryMap program itself is straightforward, but what to do about image sizes? Gigapixels?
- Alexis: reviewing HTML presentations made for previous class with “clickable” text – translating this into images with “clickable” components; watched a few YouTube tutorials about making image maps
- Set up appointments with Alice through Calendly!

### Git, GitHub, and Markdown
  a.	Git
    i.	Open-source software for version control
    ii.	Keeps track of file changes and enables them to be labelled & multiple version histories of a project to be preserved
    iii.	Why use it?
      1.	Good for collaboration, allows file conflicts to be avoided
      2.	Helps you test code, troubleshoot, or ‘undo’ changes
      3.	Enables logical “packaging” of changes and easy documentation/explanation of work; any process/feature can be broken down into its discrete components
  b.	GitHub
    i.	Hosts code and enables users to manage collaboration on projects, using Git for version control
    ii.	Good for sharing templates (e.g., for dissertations – someone should put this application to use for the Graduate Group…)
    iii.	Uses
      1.	Developing and sharing open-source tools and datasets
      2.	Free web hosting with static site builder
      3.	Makes collaboration visible and transparent
  c.	Markdown
    i.	A markup language that encodes information in plain text to be machine readable
    ii.	Creates rich text with any text editor, more sustainable than word
    iii.	More human-readable than most markup languages (e.g., HTML)
    iv.	Can be converted into any kind of document
    v.	Used for documentation on GitHub
    vi.	Efficient – no lifting hands from keyboard necessary!
IV.	Vocabulary
  a.	Repo/Repository (n): a discrete project on GitHub that contains a set of files, a change history, and a set of contributors
  b.	(to) Fork (v): to copy a repo’s files and version history to a new one with its own settings (preserves connection with original repo but doesn’t interfere) 
  c.	Local (adj): on your computer, i.e., what you would have access to if you turned off your internet
  d.	Remote (adj): on someone else’s computer (‘the cloud’)
  e.	(to) Clone (v): to download a local copy of a repo on GitHub with a tracked connection to the remote repo 
  f.	Branch (n): a version of a repository with its own history; branches can be created for a unique set of changes and later merged with the main branch to avoid file conflicts
  g.	(to) Commit (v): to package and label a discrete set of changes to a repository
  h.	Commit (n): a set of changes that has been committed
V.	“Tour” of GitHub
  a.	Homepage (Code) – where you can download arepository
  b.	To set up a repo:
    i.	Log in to your GitHub account
    ii.	Create a new repository, import one from your computer, or fork one already on GitHub
    iii.	Add recommended files (ReadMe for documentation, a license (optional), and a .gitignore)
  c.	Branching workflow
    i.	Commit changes to a new branch that diverges from the main tree
    ii.	Open a pull request to propose your changes
    iii.	A team member reviews the pull request and discusses any conflicts
    iv.	Merge pull request: incorporate your changes into the main branch
