## Agenda
1. Updates and announcements
2. Share SMART Goals
3. Discussion: How Computers Work
4. Begin Command Line tutorial

## Meeting notes
Notes from Alexis:
1. SMART goals
    Mallory:
StoryMap JS software (example on knightlab) and create an image map (there’s also Leaflet JS and ArcGIS StoryMap software, also Exhibit.so which is an digital exhibit software, also Scalar has image annotation capabilities)
3D scanning and printing an item from collections
    Kari:
Python web-scraper than can convert search terms into a series of relevant terms in specific languages. First, create a translation tool, and then a web-scraping component, and then a data storage component to the program. Alice Recommends: Automate the Boring Stuff with Python by Al Sweigart. Also LinkedIn learning course (video tutorials) on Pything: Python for Non-Programmers, the course is called “become a Python developer) Also, Python for Digital Humanities (free course on learning Python, pythonhumanities.com) Also, freecodecamp.org—Kari will need to learn how to encode different characters other than Roman alphabet.
    Alexis:
Make an image map to be able to make pictures interactive. (JavaScript libraries?) Alice shows us a scalable vector graphics, SVG, at traces.brynmawr.edu. D3 Javascript library may have resources. 
IIIF stands for international image interoperability Framework: also contains tools and activities to interact with images.
Plant humanities lab—visual essays featuring annotated images
Look into svg interactivity

2. Discussion: How Computers Work
How long will digital technology last? When file types become obsolete, what happens? How do institutions keep up?


### SMART Goals


### Discussion: How Computers Work

- [How Computers Work videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAx_6-wdslM&list=PLzdnOPI1iJNcsRwJhvksEo1tJqjIqWbN-)
  
### Command Line Tutorial

[Tutorial link](https://github.com/tri-cods/command-line)


### Resources: command line

- [Introduction to the Bash Command Line](https://programminghistorian.org/en/lessons/intro-to-bash), Ian Milligan and James Baker, The Programming Historian
- Software Carpentry's [tutorial on the Unix Shell](http://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/) (for more advanced tutorials, see the “Loops” and “Shell Scripts” sections)
- [Terminus command line game](http://web.mit.edu/mprat/Public/web/Terminus/Web/main.html) (a fantasy choose-your-own adventure like game) (good for getting use to navigating file structures--uses only a few commands)


## Action items

- [ ] Command line follow-up
  - [ ] Finish going through the [Command Line Tutorial](https://github.com/tri-cods/command-line) & post any questions to Slack
  - [ ] Optional: look at the other command line resources
- [ ] Logs
  - [ ] Create your log document: see [instructions](../logs/sample.md)
  - [ ] Write up your SMART Goal(s) and add them to your log document
  - [ ] Add a progress update to your log by Thursday morning before our next session
