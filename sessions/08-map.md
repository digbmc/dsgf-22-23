**Showcase Planning:** 

- OL 224- follow up with Visual Culture Colloquium to make sure we can use that room 
- Get topics/titles to Alice by the end of today

**Summer Conferences:** CfPs are February 15

- Association for Humanities Computing – more formal, more oriented to your research 
- Keystone DH – very friendly to grad/undergrad students 

**GIS mapping** 

- Digital Humanities Research Institute manual for mapping 
- Mapping- anything from creating a storymap (mostly a narrative in points) to evaluating land use 
- ARCGIS- industry standard run by ESRI 
- QGIS- open-source alternative to ARCGIS 
      - On the lab computers 
- Join- when two datasets refer to the same things but aren’t formatted the same way  one column that refers to both things 
- Ethical considerations 
    - How do you represent what’s not there? 
    - How have Western conceptions of space, boundaries, etc. shaped our understanding of what a map is? (colonialism, imperialism) 
    - Murky origins of datasets (US military technologies, fossil fuels, etc.) 
- Vector vs. Roster data
    - Vector- data is defined by directionality, scalable, so you can zoom in and out (lines, boundaries, shapes on a map) 
      - Shape files- shapes, directional lines, geographic coordinates they represent
    - Roster- data is defined by size/color, made out of pixels, so if you try to blow it up the image just gets fuzzy
      - Scanned images—historical map
- Feature- something like the geographic location of a findspot (where the name of the findspot would be an attribute)
