## Smart goal: 

### **Goal:** Create interactive image to use as a class presentation.

I want to use an SVG file and html/css to create a clickable picture
of one of Henry Mercer's tiles that will take the place of a PowerPoint for an end-of-semester presentation. I would like to be able
to click on areas of the image, which will link to a separate page to give information about that specific piece of the image. I also might want to reveal the
source imagery for the tile that would become visible on rollover.

### **Action Plan:**

1. ~~Trace desired image on Illustrator (done!)~~
2. ~~Re-learn HTML and CSS, play around with VSC to become familiar with the program (11/14-11/20)~~
3. ~~Create code to make the image function the way that I want (11/21-11/27)~~
4. Add in the real image along with the SVG file and add some rollover effects (like outlining the shapes, etc)
5. Add writing to the pages based on the research that I'm doing into the title, as well as extra images to support my claims (11/28-12/5)
6. Repeat entire process with second image 
7. Add a similar clickable SVG of the entire installation of the tiles as the first page, making some tiles clickable so that they then link to an individual page for that tile

### **Updates on Progress:**

I traced one of the tiles and made it into an SVG file, with different areas of the tile under discussion being different shapes. Then I made each of the shapes link to text within the same page. I googled how to make a scrollable block of text within the same page. When one of the shapes gets clicked on, it links to a different paragraph of text explaining it, which appears in the box to the right of the image. Next, I want to do the same thing with a different tile. Then I will focus on styling the pages to make them more polished looking.
