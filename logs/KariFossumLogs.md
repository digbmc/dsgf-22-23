# **SMART Goal (as of 10/21)**

## **Goal 1:** to use Python to construct a web-scraping tool capable of (1) scraping selected websites and/or databases for the searched-for term(s) as well as their translations or alternative names in all known languages of publication, especially those that have traditionally presented a more significant barrier to access like Russian, Ukrainian, and Romanian, and (2) storing the results.

## **Preliminary Actions:**
1.	Research the most efficient way to use Python to convert a searched-for term into its translations in selected languages
2.	Research how Python can be used to create a web-scraping and data storage tool and assess what option(s) are best suited to my purposes
3.	Determine what websites and/or databases I want to scrape
4.	Write necessary code to construct translation tool
5.	Write necessary code to construct web-scraping tool
6.	Write necessary code to construct data storage tool
## **Timeline (M, T):**

### **October**
- By 10/21: determine methods for constructing (1) a tool to “translate” searched-for terms, (2) a web-scraping tool, and (3) a data storage tool, using Python
- By 10/28: compile preliminary lists of (1) terms and translations and (2) websites to be scraped

### **November**
- By 11/4: write code for “translation” tool
- By 11/11: troubleshoot “translation” tool
- By 11/18: write code for web-scraping tool
- By 11/25: troubleshoot web-scraping tool

### **December**
- By 12/2: write code for data storage tool
- By 12/9: troubleshoot data storage tool
- By 12/16
- By 12/23

# **11/10 Log**

## **Accomplishments:**

## **Updates:**
- working on revising my SMART Goal! I am still trying to develop a clearer idea for how to use Python for archaeology, both in general terms and for my own specific research; this week, this looks like refreshing my Python skills using online tutorials and "researching" how other scholars have incorporated Python into their research in archaeology, classics, and art history
- constructing a new SMART Goal, namely, to use StoryMaps and/or GIS to make an interactive map of the findspots of the objects in the dataset that I'm building for my thesis; I'm currently playing around with StoryMaps and reading about GIS and approaches to geospatial data 
## Other Updates:

## **12/16 Log**

## **Accomplishments:**
- found suitable base maps (i.e., without modern political borders!) for my coin distribution maps and mapped all of my currend findspots, currently finisihing up inputting the data that will also go in my thesis catalogue (e.g., coin types, quantities, deposition contexts)

## **Updates(/Plans):**
- interested in seeing if there is a way to use GIS to calculate ancient travel time (à la https://orbis.stanford.edu/) between my sites/findspots
- still planning to dedicating some time over break to planning & starting a Python project!
