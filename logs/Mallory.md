# GOALS

## SMART Goal: 

Use Knightlab Storymaps to create a storymap for a Greek vase. Explore and compare other platforms (exhibit.so, IIIF) that could be used to do the same thing. 

- **Specific**: how will you work towards that goal? 

  - I can read documentation, watch tutorials, and experiment, first with Knightlab and the tools it uses to build an interactive storymap (GitHub, Zoomify apps, Domain of One’s Own). 

  - After learning these tools and making a successful Knightlab map, I can put these tools into practice with other related platforms and programs like exhibit.so and IIIF to compare the features and capabilities of each for image mapping and annotation. 

- **Measurable**: what can you do to measure your progress? 

  - I can spend two hours a week reading documentation, watching tutorials, and experimenting with storymapping platforms (first Knightlab, then exhibit.so and IIIF). 

- **Actionable**: break it down into individual tasks and pieces that you are able to accomplish on your own 

  1. Research size requirements for choosing an image and pick out some options. 
  2. Choose an image and identify points of interest for analysis. 
  3. Research ways to zoomify an image. Test possible methods (Photoshop, downloadable app, command-line tools) and practice zoomifying images. 
  4. Research possible host spots for zoomified images (GitHub, Domain of One’s Own). Test possible host spots and put chosen image on a webserver—or possibly several, depending on research results. 
  5. Use Knightlab’s storymapping program to build the interactive storymap and integrate it with feature-by-feature image analysis. 
  6. Research how the tools and technology of Knightlab storymaps compare to those used by exhibit.so and IIIF. 
  7. Experiment with the same image I use for the Knightlab map on with exhibit.so and IIIF.   

- **Relevant**: make sure it's important enough to motivate you 
  - Creating storymaps like these would be a great way to examine, analyze, and explore manuscripts, vase paintings, and mind maps like the one I envisioned for the Freeze! exhibition.

  - It’s a good way to pull out details about a specific image, or to highlight the connections between different elements of an image
  
- **Time-based**: set reasonable deadlines

  - November 20- have an image chosen and test zoomifying it 

  - November 27- host the image on the web and begin testing integrated text

  - December 11- have the text analysis written up

  - December 18- Knightlabs storymap up and running
  
  - January 29- choose which other images, features, and capabilities I want to explore on exhibit.so and IIIF 

  - February 12- have attempted a comparative image/storymap using exhibit.so and/or IIIF 


## Biweekly Updates

### 11/04

I've decided to focus on storymapping for this project, though I'm definitely interested in doing more 3D scanning/printing work in the future.

- This sounds great!
- If you are testing out Exhibit.so you might try that earlier in case it fits your needs better than storymaps.
