# GOALS

## SMART Goal: 

Use Knightlab Storymaps to create a storymap for a Greek vase. Explore and compare other platforms (exhibit.so, IIIF) that could be used to do the same thing. 

**Specific**: how will you work towards that goal? 

-I can read documentation, watch tutorials, and experiment, first with Knightlab and the tools it uses to build an interactive storymap (GitHub, Zoomify apps, Domain of One’s Own). 

-After learning these tools and making a successful Knightlab map, I can put these tools into practice with other related platforms and programs like exhibit.so and IIIF to compare the features and capabilities of each for image mapping and annotation. 

**Measurable**: what can you do to measure your progress? 

-I can spend two hours a week reading documentation, watching tutorials, and experimenting with storymapping platforms (first Knightlab, then exhibit.so and IIIF). 

**Actionable**: break it down into individual tasks and pieces that you are able to accomplish on your own 
1. Research size requirements for choosing an image and pick out some options. 
2. Choose an image and identify points of interest for analysis. 
3. Research ways to zoomify an image. Test possible methods (Photoshop, downloadable app, command-line tools) and practice zoomifying images. 
4. Research possible host spots for zoomified images (GitHub, Domain of One’s Own). Test possible host spots and put chosen image on a webserver—or possibly several, depending on research results. 
5. Use Knightlab’s storymapping program to build the interactive storymap and integrate it with feature-by-feature image analysis. 
6. Research how the tools and technology of Knightlab storymaps compare to those used by exhibit.so and IIIF. 
7. Experiment with the same image I use for the Knightlab map on with exhibit.so and IIIF.   

**Relevant**: make sure it's important enough to motivate you 

-Creating storymaps like these would be a great way to examine, analyze, and explore manuscripts, vase paintings, and mind maps like the one I envisioned for the Freeze! exhibition.

-It’s a good way to pull out details about a specific image, or to highlight the connections between different elements of an image
  
**Time-based**: set reasonable deadlines

-November 20- have an image chosen and test zoomifying it 

-November 27- host the image on the web and begin testing integrated text

-December 11- have the text analysis written up

-December 18- Knightlabs storymap up and running  

-January 29- choose which other images, features, and capabilities I want to explore on exhibit.so and IIIF 

-February 12- have attempted a comparative image/storymap using exhibit.so and/or IIIF 


# Biweekly Updates

11/04/22- I've decided to focus on storymapping for this project, though I'm definitely interested in doing more 3D scanning/printing work in the future. 

11/25/22- After zoomifying a number of possible images, I've started experimenting with putting them on the web to get them into a Storymap. I thought I uploaded one of the zoomified images, a Greek vase with Niobe on it, to GitHub as per the instructions on the Knightlab Storymaps page here: [GitHub Hosting](https://github.com/NUKnightLab/StoryMapJS/blob/master/GITHUB_HOSTING/GITHUB_HOSTING.md). But when I tried to use the link to make it a Storymap, it doesn't give me any image. Now I've got a main repository [Niobe](https://github.com/mmfitzpatr/niobe) and a branch [Niobe--without files](https://github.com/mmfitzpatr/niobe/tree/folder) that's a bunch of commits behind the main page, because I was testing a couple things to try and figure out what I did wrong, but neither is doing what I want to right now, so it seems. I'll probably try and set up a meeting with you, Alice, but in the meantime, all suggestions are welcome! 

12/01/22- With Alice's help, I got the Niobe storymap running--sort of. Turns out there are some browser constraints, and figuring out the zooming in and out is a bit tricky. Ideally I'll want to keep working with this storymap [link here](https://uploads.knightlab.com/storymapjs/124092d52edd3c677352a1fbf731b197/niobe/index.html) while also experimenting with several images on the Knightlab Storymap as well as some of the same images on exhibit.so. 

12/15/22- So I've now got three storymaps I've put up. There's the Niobe vase on Knightlab, linked above, but also the Niobe vase on exhibit.so [here](https://www.exhibit.so/exhibits/edit/gDhmJoW5ZzcYwIXVvGU3) and I finally got my kinesis mind map onto Knightlab [here](https://uploads.knightlab.com/storymapjs/124092d52edd3c677352a1fbf731b197/kinesis/draft.html)! But Knightlab is still being quite finicky. Getting it to zoom in and out when and where I want it is proving difficult. It may improve with more slides--I've only tried one or two, and haven't put any real text in yet. But I would like to figure out the zoom issues first! More experimenting will be needed. The exhibit.so platform is definitely simpler to work with so far. But it's also more limited in some ways--I find myself wanting to be able to circle or highlight specific details on zoomed-in spots. Is there a way to mark up the image within the site? 

01/19/23- As I mentioned in our meeting yesterday, my storymaps have been giving me trouble in the editing phase. I just submitted a form to their help page to see if they have any suggestions. In the meantime, I guess I'd better start exploring exhibit.so a bit more closely, which I haven't done much of yet. My questions from my last post about image annotation within the site remain, but I'll keep poking around. (One other thing I didn't mention at our meeting yesterday is that I did play a bit with over break, but I don't think I'm hosting it correctly? It exists as a file I can open in a browser from my computer right now, but I can't seem to link it anywhere meaning it isn't really published. I think I have to get it on my Domain of One's Own? Alice, at some point I'll probably try and make an appointment to talk about this. I did download a template and start making use of that though. More to be done, as always, but it's been kind of fun.)
